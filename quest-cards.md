# TypeScript Hero Quest Cards

## Week 1 Quest: "Bugzilla's Inventory Chaos"

**Quest Giver**: Type Master Kai
**Difficulty**: Beginner
**Objective**: Restore order to TechCorp's chaotic inventory system

### Mission Briefing

Bugzilla has sabotaged our inventory management system, causing constant crashes when trying to process different item types. We need you to implement a type-safe inventory system using TypeScript arrays and functions to prevent these runtime errors.

### Quest Requirements

1. Create typed arrays for different inventory categories (weapons, potions, artifacts)
2. Implement type-safe functions to add/remove items
3. Use arrow functions with proper type annotations for all operations
4. Process inventory lists with forEach and typed callbacks
5. Achieve zero TypeScript compilation errors

### Rewards

- 100 XP
- "Data Defender" Title
- 25 Bonus XP for zero TypeScript errors

### Lore

_"In the early days of JavaScript, developers lived in chaos, never knowing what type of data would appear in their arrays. With TypeScript, we bring order to this chaos!"_ - Type Master Kai

## Week 2 Quest: "Interface Igor's Blueprint Challenge"

**Quest Giver**: Interface Igor
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Objective**: Create robust blueprints for TechCorp's game systems

### Mission Briefing

Bugzilla is targeting our game development division, corrupting player and monster data structures. Interface Igor needs your help to create ironclad contracts that will prevent these corruptions.

### Quest Requirements

1. Design `IPlayer` and `IMonster` interfaces with all required properties
2. Implement classes that satisfy these interfaces
3. Use access modifiers appropriately (public/private)
4. Create enum for game states and actions
5. Implement type-safe combat methods

### Rewards

- 150 XP
- "Contract Keeper" Badge
- 50 Bonus XP for perfect interface implementation

### Lore

_"An interface is like a magical contract - it guarantees that objects will have exactly what you expect, preventing the chaos Bugzilla loves to create."_ - Interface Igor

## Week 3 Quest: "Generic Guardian's UI Defense"

**Quest Giver**: Generic Guardian
**Difficulty**: Advanced
**Objective**: Secure TechCorp's user interfaces from DOM manipulation attacks

### Mission Briefing

Bugzilla has been injecting malicious code into our user interfaces, causing null reference errors and type mismatches. The Generic Guardian needs you to fortify our UI with proper DOM typing and type-safe event handling.

### Quest Requirements

1. Properly type all DOM elements and selectors
2. Implement type-safe event handlers
3. Create generic utility functions for DOM operations
4. Safely store and retrieve typed data with localStorage
5. Achieve zero `any` type usage

### Rewards

- 200 XP
- "DOM Defender" Title
- 75 Bonus XP for zero type assertions

### Lore

_"Generics are my specialty - they allow us to create flexible, reusable code that maintains type safety. With them, we can defend against Bugzilla's polymorphic attacks!"_ - Generic Guardian

## Week 4 Quest: "The Final API Integration"

**Quest Giver**: Type Master Kai
**Difficulty**: Expert
**Objective**: Protect TechCorp's data pipelines from malformed API responses

### Mission Briefing

This is it - Bugzilla's final assault targets our external API integrations. You must implement a completely type-safe data fetching system that can handle any malformed response without crashing our systems.

### Quest Requirements

1. Create comprehensive interfaces for API responses
2. Implement generic fetch wrappers with proper error handling
3. Use union types for loading states
4. Add type guards for API response validation
5. Maintain zero TypeScript errors in strict mode

### Rewards

- 250 XP
- "Type Champion" Title
- 100 Bonus XP for strict mode compliance
- Unlock "Generic Guru" and "Strict Mode Survivor" badges

### Lore

_"You've come far, young TypeScript Hero. With proper typing of asynchronous operations, you now have the power to protect TechCorp from any data-related threat!"_ - Type Master Kai
